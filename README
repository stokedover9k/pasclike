This package contains a parser and a lexical analyzer for a Pascal-like language.

NOTE: The code was tested on energon1.

=======================================
=========      COMPILE      ===========
=======================================
Executing 'make' will compile the parser by default.

* compile parser: 'make parser-pasclike'
* compile scanner: 'make scanner-pasclike'

----- Parser -----
The parser is compiled by executing 'make parser-pasclike'. An executable named
"parser-pasclike" will be created. This program takes the input program as its
first argument. If no argument is given, the parser reads the program from standard
input. The parser will produce a file "symtable.out" with the printout of the symbol
table of the parsed program.

----- Scanner ----
the scanner is compiled by executing 'make scanner-pasclike'. An executable named
"scanner-pasclike" will be created. This program takes the name of the file containing
the input data (the program to parse) as its first argument and reports to standard
output. If no file name is provided, the scanner reads from standard input.

========================================
===========     RUN     ================
========================================
Both the scanner and the parser take as their first arguments the name of the program
to be processed. If no such file is provided, they read from the standard input.

* run  parser: ./parser-pasclike   test-program-data
           or: ./parser-pasclike < test-program-date
* run scanner: ./scanner-pasclike  test-program-data
           or: ./scanner-pasclike < test-program-data



----- Implementation Notes -----
* Logging:
  pasclike.l contains logging code.  This logging is currently disabled
  and can be ignored.  To enable, run make with 
    CFLAGS=-DFILELOG_MAX_LEVEL=logDEBUG4
  The logging library is a slightly modified library taken from Dr. Dobbs
  website.

* Output Organization:
  Currently, the scanner's output is produced in main.cpp (not the Flex 
  file pasclike.l) based on the tokens returned by yylex().
