This package contains a lexical analyzer for a Pascal-like language.

NOTE: The code was tested on energon1.

----- Compile -----
Execute 'make' in this directory.  An executable named "scanner-pasclike"
which reads from stdandard input and reports to standard output will be
produced.

----- Run -----
./scanner-pasclike < test-program-data

----- Implementation Notes -----
* Logging:
  pasclike.l contains logging code.  This logging is currently disabled
  and can be ignored.  To enable, run make with 
    CFLAGS=-DFILELOG_MAX_LEVEL=logDEBUG4
  The logging library is a slightly modified library taken from Dr. Dobbs
  website.

* Output Organization:
  Currently, the program's output is produced in main.cpp (not the Flex 
  file pasclike.l) based on the tokens returned by yylex().
